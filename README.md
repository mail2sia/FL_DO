## Overview

We introduce a **privacy-preserving framework** for mental health sentiment analysis, combining:
- **Federated Learning (FL)** for decentralized model training,
- **Data Obfuscation (DO)** for privacy protection,
- **BERT** for high-accuracy emotion classification.

This system, **FL-BERT+DO**, effectively balances user privacy and model performance, outperforming traditional differential privacy approaches.

## Main Contributions

- **FL-BERT+DO Framework**  
  - Combines federated learning with a novel data obfuscation strategy.
  - Achieves robust sentiment prediction while enhancing privacy.

- **Empirical Privacy Validation**  
  - Evaluated against membership inference and linkage attacks.
  - Global model membership inference AUC: 22.40% (low risk).

- **Superior Predictive Performance**  
  - Test Accuracy: **82.74%**
  - Precision: **83.30%**
  - Recall: **82.74%**
  - F1-Score: **82.80%**

- **Comparison to Differential Privacy (DP) Approaches**  
  - Outperforms FL-DP, which achieved only ~16.7% accuracy.

- **Support for Mental Health Monitoring**  
  - Enables decentralized, privacy-conscious mental health analytics.

## Dataset

- **Emotions in Text Dataset**  
  - ðŸ”— [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishantjuyal/emotions-in-text)
  - Supplemented with a **synthetic obfuscated dataset** (rule-based generation) for privacy.
